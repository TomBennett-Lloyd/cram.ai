# Friction log

_Ported from [cumulo](https://github.com/TomBennett-Lloyd/cumulo) on 2026-10-13 (header only; cumulo's entries were not carried over)._

Weak signals from `/retro` that don't yet have a clear improvement action — recorded so patterns become visible across tasks ("we churn on X in half of tasks") instead of being forced into premature lessons. `/triage` mines this for repeats (≥3 similar entries, or affecting ≥50% of recent tasks) and converts patterns into workflow issues, deleting captured entries. Singletons stay until they repeat or go stale.

This file's own path has a restatement ledger (`docs/standards/architecture.md` rule 9): `.claude/ledgers/friction-log-path.ledger`, which `check:ledgers` re-runs.

## 2026-10-20 — PR #82

- Phase: review
- Observed: the eval course's audit catches a `mustNotContain` entry that appears literally in the deck's own text, but not one that a correct answer _negating_ the slide would trip (the first cycle-1 finding, with three more questions missing a citation to a slide that repeats the answer); the audit's arm is literal, the defect was semantic, and only a reader caught it. One ticket so far; #47's runner is the first consumer that could surface it mechanically.

## 2026-10-20 — PR #89

- Phase: planning
- Observed: the #80 plan claimed `eval/src` would pass the comment-density gate once covered, on the strength of a pre-plan run that measured the old scope (16 files, `eval/` excluded); the widened gate put two files over the median and added a docblock cut to the scope mid-flight. A claim about a widened gate needs the widened gate run first. One ticket so far.

## 2026-10-20 — PR #101

- Phase: planning
- Observed: the first lane to run under `.claude/agents/ticket-agent.md` § 2's new sweep sentence (#87) found a carrier its issue did not name — `task-orchestrator.md` rule 1's reconcile range, which PR #96's narrower sweep had missed — and declared it as a footprint change before the first edit. No new signal; recorded so the next graduation check can see the rule's first catch.

## 2026-10-20 — PR #116

- Phase: implementation
- Observed: the #93 lane wrote `Map.groupBy` into a test fixture; it is ES2024 and the base tsconfig's `lib` is ES2023, so `tsc` refused it before any test ran and the fixture groups by hand. The gate did its job at no cost; recorded because the `lib` ceiling is a value an implementer meets only by hitting it. One ticket so far.

## 2026-10-20 — PR #123

- Phase: planning
- Observed: the #79 plan chose `@napi-rs/canvas` as a devDependency of `eval/` on the reasoning that devDependencies are outside `check:no-network-egress`'s scan. Adding it anywhere in the workspace satisfied `unpdf`'s optional peer, so pnpm re-resolved `@cram/ingest`'s production `unpdf` against it and the gate flagged the Skia binary in ingest's production tree. The lane switched to `jimp` (pure JS, no peer coupling) and re-planned once. A devDependency can change another importer's production tree through optional-peer resolution; only the gate saw it. One ticket so far.

## 2026-10-20 — PR #137

- Phase: review
- Observed: the #78 lane's first commit filtered references slides with one shared `rowid in` clause, which made the FTS5 word search re-run its match once per id, 165 times slower at 3000 slides, and `pnpm verify` stayed green because the retrieval timing test runs only under `CRAM_MEASURE=1`. The reviewer's manual measured run caught it, and #136 now asks what gates a retrieval query-plan or latency regression. One ticket so far; the RESUME after the lane's rate-limit death redid nothing, which is recorded here as the recovery path working rather than as friction.

## 2026-10-20 — PR #118

- Phase: planning
- Observed: issue #57 ended "Decision needed (owner)", and the lane answered the question from the repo's documents instead of stopping BLOCKED, leaving a "Contrary reading" paragraph for the merge owner; the merge owner held the PR for the owner's word, which came a few hours later and agreed. The #56 and #47 lanes, given owner-shaped questions the same day, stopped at the plan. `.claude/agents/ticket-agent.md` § 5 (d) names "owner taste" as a stop trigger and says nothing about an issue that labels its own question as the owner's. One ticket so far on the lane deciding; the reviewer's pathspec finding (an edge no guard-edge mutant named) is the shape #188 now owns.

## 2026-10-21 — PR #167

- Phase: implementation
- Observed: the #20 lane's first live `models:pull` run and its mutant run both preceded the last review edits to the script and harness, so both were redone after review (one cold-path reinstall of a 2.5 GB download, one mutant run). The lane's order was build, measure, review, fix; the fix invalidated the measurement. One ticket so far on measuring before review on a script whose review changes its behaviour.

## 2026-10-21 — PR #177

- Phase: process
- Observed: the rule PR #177 adds was written and merged within two hours of the #159 lane raising an unsanctioned macOS automation prompt (`.claude/agents/ticket-agent.md` § 5 (g)), and the #159 lane itself stopped cleanly on a HOLD, deleted what it had created and reported its probe findings with provenance. No new signal; recorded so the rule's first catch, if any, has its origin dated.

## 2026-10-21 — PR #197

- Phase: implementation
- Observed: the time-box red that #152 recorded at load average 90–100 did not reproduce for its lane at load averages of 41 to 76 on 10 cores (three runs of three green; a bare stub call measured 42 ms at most), so the lane removed the race rather than tuning a margin, with a regression case that fails on the pre-fix harness. A load-dependent red that cannot be reproduced on demand is fixed by construction or not at all; the lane's answer was the right one. One ticket so far.

## 2026-10-21 — PR #215

- Phase: implementation
- Observed: the #16 lane ran `pnpm verify` eleven times, each taking 9 to 15 minutes, while fourteen to sixteen lanes shared the machine at a load average of 90 to 100; one run was a re-run after #152's time-box signature (fixed since by PR #197). The lane's work (86 files, four review passes, a browser-smoke pass) was not the cost; the verify runs were, and most of that was waiting on the other lanes' runs. The parallelism bought wall-clock across tickets and paid it back inside each. One lane's figures so far; the effort pilot (#140) records tokens and duration per lane and is where the trade-off becomes visible.

## 2026-10-21 — PR #248

- Phase: planning
- Observed: the #231 lane's plan comment described its first design (a stub that returned a `holdAsk()` closure) in detail; review replaced it with a named option under `docs/standards/structure.md` rule 2, and the plan comment then cost two confirmation rounds of prose drift, because struck text beside new text read as still live and only rewriting the sections whole passed. One ticket so far on a plan comment that commits to a shape before review has seen it.

## 2026-10-21 — PR #263

- Phase: implementation
- Observed: the #233 plan split the shared `IngestStatus` shape change (step 2) from the web consumer that answers it (step 3), and the lane had to land both in one commit because `pnpm verify` is whole-repo and the web package is red between them. A plan step that changes a shared type is not committable on its own; nothing in `.claude/agents/planner.md` asks whether a step's `Verify:` can pass before its consumers move. One ticket so far.

## 2026-10-21 — PR #291

- Phase: implementation
- Observed: the frontend-gate probe harness compares sets of `line:rule` pairs and merges duplicates, so it cannot see a rule reporting one fault twice; the #280 lane added a counting case for its own rule only. The lane also spent one fix round after removing comment handling on the measurement that postcss strips comments, which holds except for a comment with no whitespace on either side. One ticket so far on each.

## 2026-10-21 — PR #313

- Phase: planning
- Observed: the #283 plan set pdf.js's deletion of `<` and `>` aside as out of scope without checking it against the inverse the plan relied on, and the reviewer found that the deletion can break that inverse because pdf.js edits the string it reorders (filed as #305). The lane also rewrote three regex lines twice because a `\uXXXX` escape typed into a tool parameter arrives as the literal character. One ticket so far on each.

## 2026-10-21 — PR #313 (merge)

- Phase: process
- Observed: `merge-pr.sh`'s first run on PR #313 did `gh pr update-branch`, polled the new head green, and then refused at the merge step because the PR was `BEHIND` again: the #310 retro PR had merged during the poll. The merge owner's retro chains and lane-PR merges each serialise behind the merge they queue on, but not behind each other, so two independent chains can land one PR inside another's checks poll and cost it a full second CI round. First instance recorded; PR #235's entry (poll budget; deleted as stale by PR #303) was a different cause.

## 2026-10-21 — PR #324

- Phase: implementation
- Observed: the #300 lane's first cut used SQLite's read-only open flag and three repair tests failed, because a read-only connection leaves `-wal` and `-shm` beside the file on close and `rebuildCourse` reads a `-wal` as another connection still holding the file; `PRAGMA query_only` on a normal connection was the fix. One ticket so far on a library flag whose side effect is in the file system rather than in the API. Also the first `REBASE` bounce under `run-issue` step 5's pasted form (PR #310): seven shared files, resolved with no correction from the lane.

## 2026-10-21 — PR #336

- Phase: dispatch
- Observed: the #296 lane reported no friction of its own, but its merge made PR #337 (#294) DIRTY on the same `.claude/agents/ticket-agent.md` § 4 paragraph, costing that lane a source-conflict rebase round; a third lane (#293, PR #334) edits § 2 of the same file. The merge owner admitted all three in parallel with the overlap named in each dispatch, pricing it as rebase cost; a same-paragraph edit on an agent definition is same-file SOURCE overlap by `run-issue` step 1's own rule and should have been sequenced or batched at dispatch. One ticket so far on agent-definition edits colliding.

## 2026-10-21 — PR #329

- Phase: rebase
- Observed: in one of the #302 lane's three rebase rounds, a delete script whose assertion failed still reached `rebase --continue`, because the chain used `;` rather than `&&`; a tip commit made the missed deletion. Two of the three rounds were forced by redirect-row deletions on `docs/tech-debt.md` (#324, #327), both log-only. Counts toward a lane-side rule that a scripted rebase step chains with `&&` (`docs/standards/evidence.md` form 8 asserts the edit's count; this is the step after it).

## 2026-10-21 — PR #266

- Phase: implementation
- Observed: the #165 lane mutated the test-exclusion regex but not the line that applies it to the basename, and review found the surviving mutant. The guard's edges include the site that applies the pattern, not only the pattern's arms; second instance of a mutant list stopping at the regex (PR #278's anchoring mutants were the first, now in ticket-agent § 4's axes rule). One ticket so far on the application site.

## 2026-10-21 — PR #345

- Phase: merge
- Observed: the #297 lane found that `merge-pr.sh` has unioned a conflict confined to `APPEND_ONLY_LOGS` since #60 (PR #64), so the issue's proposed script change was already shipped; triage wrote the fix direction without reading the script's union step. On the merge owner's side, every log-only `REBASE —` bounce sent today (PRs #266, #269, #275, #324, #327 twice, #329 twice, #334) was avoidable under that union, each costing a lane round and a CI run; PR #345's step 5 now reads the conflicted set first. Second instance today of a triage issue restating shipped behaviour (#332's carrier sweep is the other).

## 2026-10-21 — PR #289

- Phase: implementation
- Observed: the #268 lane left two background wait loops of the form `until ! pgrep -f 268-mut/mutate.py; do sleep 15; done` running for 4 h 44 min after the PR merged: `pgrep -f` matched the loop's own command line, so the loop could never see the script finish. The lane read its result file directly and never noticed. The merge owner's `kill` was refused by the permission classifier and the owner killed them by hand. One ticket so far on a self-matching `pgrep -f` wait.

## 2026-10-21 — PR #351

- Phase: review
- Observed: the #276 lane argued away the plan's untracked-file arm during implementation by reasoning about module resolution, and the reviewer refuted the argument with a shadowing counterexample. An argument for deleting a planned guard needs a mutant shape drawn from the grammar list, not reasoning alone; one ticket so far, and ticket-agent § 4's hostile-corpus rule (PR #336) is the nearest home if it recurs.
